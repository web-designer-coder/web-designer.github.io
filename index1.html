Bugatti states that the Tourbillon is a completely new design, and does not share any components with the outgoing Chiron, but in keeping with the Bugatti brand lineage, it does share many of its key design cues, including the horseshoe grille, central spine, C-shaped side body lines, and two-tone body colour. One of the stated inspirations for the Tourbillon was mechanical watches, with the car containing a fully analog center console operated by mechanical gears, designed to look like a watch movement, while the speedometer and tachometer needles were arranged to resemble an hour and minute hand.[6] Another design theme of the Tourbillon is a "skeletonized" mechanical design, where the mechanisms of components are made visible as a part of the design.
